A Bee Story

     A bee family is a big family. Can you believe that a mother bee has hundreds and hundreds of baby bees? You see, she does nothing in her life but lay eggs. She can lay 100 eggs in a day. So a beehive has more bees than you can count.

     There is only one mother bee in a bee family. When she is born, her body is different from the other bees. She is born a queen and she does no work in the beehive. The queen bee is the mother of the bee family.

A great number of bees are workers. They do all the work in the beehive. They go out to get food for the family. They serve the queen and take care of the baby bees.

     The bees are often seen among the flowers. They sip the sweet nectar from the flowers. They go from one flower to another to gather nectar. Sweet nectar is the food of the bees.
